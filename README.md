### **What_can_you_do_with_this_code?**

This code allows you to **scrap the emails of the townhalls of several French administrations.**

You can choose to **store the emails** in a Json file or in a Google_spreadsheet that you can also download as a CSV file.

You can then **send an email to the whole database** using gmail.

You can **send a tweet to the administrations** to remind them of the email you sent.


### **How_to_use**

1.  `Git clone` our repository
2.  `Bundle install`our gems
3.   `Ruby app.rb` and follow instructions

***Careful!***

*- In order to use google spreadsheet features, gmail features, twitter features and Json, you need to paste your own .env and config.json files into the repository*

***- In Json_scrapper.rb***, *make sure you change the path to fit your own computer path*

***- In csv.rb***, *make sure you change the path to fit your own computer path AND change the spreadsheet file name to your own*

***- In spreadsheet_scrapper.rb***, *make sure you change the ID of the google spreadsheet to reflect the spreadsheet you want to copy your data into.*
